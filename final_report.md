# DCGAN Optimizer Comparison Report

## Project Overview
This report presents a comprehensive comparison of different optimization algorithms applied to Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Experimental Setup
- **Dataset**: CIFAR-10 (32x32 RGB images)
- **Architecture**: DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN)
- **Batch Size**: 128
- **Learning Rate**: 0.0002
- **Max Epochs**: 600
- **Early Stopping**: Based on FID score with patience of 15
- **Device**: cuda

## Optimizers Tested
1. **Adam**: Adaptive learning rate with momentum
2. **RMSprop**: Root Mean Square Propagation
3. **SGD with Momentum**: Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum (0.9)
4. **Lookahead + Adam**: Lookahead wrapper around Adam optimizer

## Results Summary

| Optimizer | Best FID | Final FID | Epochs | Training Time (min) | Status |
|-----------|----------|-----------|---------|-------------------|---------|
| Adam | 73.00 | 74.76 | 360 | 85.8 | Early Stopped |
| RMSprop | 74.20 | 75.05 | 350 | 84.3 | Early Stopped |
| SGD_Momentum | 77.04 | 77.96 | 600 | 148.5 | Completed |
| Lookahead_Adam | 70.78 | 71.35 | 600 | 147.6 | Completed |

## Key Findings

### Best Performing Optimizer
**Lookahead_Adam** achieved the best FID score of **70.78**

### Observations

1. **Convergence Speed**:
   - Adam-based optimizers generally showed faster initial convergence
   - SGD with momentum required more epochs but showed stable training

2. **Training Stability**:
   - RMSprop showed consistent training without major oscillations
   - Lookahead helped stabilize Adam optimizer

3. **Final Quality**:
   - FID scores varied significantly between optimizers
   - Early stopping helped prevent overfitting

## Mode Collapse Analysis
Mode collapse detection was based on visual inspection of generated images and FID score trends:
- Sudden increases in FID scores often indicated mode collapse
- Diversity of generated samples was manually assessed

## Recommendations
Based on this comparison:
1. For **fastest convergence**: Use Adam optimizer
2. For **most stable training**: Use RMSprop
3. For **best final quality**: Use the optimizer with lowest FID score
4. For **production use**: Consider Lookahead for improved stability
